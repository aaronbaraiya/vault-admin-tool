# vault-admin-tool
In collaboration with the full stack developer at MSI we developed a Vault Admin Tool using C# and ASP.NET Razor Pages to automate SQL permission generation and configure Vault database roles, token roles, and policies. Implemented multi-step UI workflows, dynamic role naming, and secure API communication with HashiCorp Vault.
